# Projects

## Emurma-Base
Emurma-Base is the project as I was given it. Only fixed up with Nuget Packets and converted to Dotnet 8.0.

## Re-Emura and Emura-Lib
Re-Emura is the actual reimplementation in C++. It uses Emura-Lib which is just Emura-Base turned into a library and used to load data.

## What does Re-Emura provide 

- GUI and text rendering ported to C++
- A game launcher and not having to store them right next to the exe
- Multithreaded loading

# Building

## Emurma-Base
Emurma base uses Dotnet 8.
